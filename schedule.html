          <h2>Picking Dates</h2>
<p>Our first conversation was in June, our first planning call was a couple weeks later, and camp was the first weekend in October. We picked a weekend that was far enough out that people were unlikely to already have it booked.</p>
<p>We didn’t bother trying to coordinate the calendars of 12 people, because that way lies madness. If we hadn’t done held camp in October, we would have had to wait until Spring, and I am far too impatient for that. Pick a date that works for your organizers (and your anchor attendees, if you have a few identified), and don't fret too much about getting it right for everyone.</p>
<p>Camp kickoff was Thursday dinner, and ended officially on Saturday afternoon. This was a nice balance, taking up one weekday and one weekend day. A few people headed home Saturday night, but most of us stayed through Sunday morning.</p>
