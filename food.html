        <h1>Food</h1>
        <section id="main_content">

        <p>Our crew had a high percentage of people for whom it was important not just to eat, but to eat <em>well</em>. I'm not talking caviar-well, but nice cheeses and fresh vegetables and delicious bread. My partner Aaron and I used to run a bakery and do catering, so we were up to the challenge. Food prep is an area that scares a lot of people, so I'm including enough info here so you could copy this exact menu and be fine for your retreat.</p>
        <p><img src="images/dinner.jpg" alt="full spread of dinner delights"></p>


        <p>We had a few gluten-free folks in the group, so this menu works around that restriction. We didn't have any vegetarians with us, so if your group does you'll need to revamp a few of these meals.</p>

        <p>Despite our careful calculations, we still ended up with too much food. Not <em>comically</em> too much food (well, except in the case of ice cream), but still - too much food. This menu would easily feed 14, and people who are driving home after the retreat are going to have to do their part and take home half-eaten loaves of bread and whatnot. Be warned.</p>

        <h2>Dessert</h2>
        <p>Let's just say that we bought <strong>way</strong> too much dessert. Turns out we were not really a dessert crew - it actually felt really good for us all to eat more like we do at home and not overindulge. So maybe a set of s'more makings (it is camp, after all) and some ice cream, and you're good to go.
